**Esperenza** is a web platform built with **Next.js 14 (TypeScript)** that turns every transaction into a small act of climate action.  
It combines a **Celo-powered wallet**, an **eco-goodie marketplace**, and a **referral exchange** connecting campus ambassadors (Granters) with users (Seekers).  
Every action contributes to greener initiatives through transparent, on-chain micro-donations.

## ✨ Core Idea

> *Grow your wallet. Grow the planet.*

Esperenza bridges digital finance, sustainability, and community:
- 🌱 **Eco Wallet** – simple Celo wallet tied to phone number or address, where each cUSD transaction contributes a micro-donation toward verified green projects.  
- 🎁 **Marketplace** – redeem eco-points for sustainable goodies and merch.  
- 🤝 **Referral Exchange** – connect **Granters** (who share referral codes for tools like Gemini, Comet, or Perplexity) with **Seekers** (who need them).  
  - Each successful referral = +1 eco-point.  
  - At 50 points, Granters become **Closed** until they donate Celo tokens to reopen.  
  - Donations go directly to partnered NGOs via smart contract.
